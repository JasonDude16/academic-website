      - title: Electroencephalogram aperiodic power spectral slope can be reliably measured and predicts ADHD risk in early development
        content: The aperiodic exponent of the electroencephalogram (EEG) power spectrum has received growing attention as a physiological marker of neurodevelopmental psychopathology, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, its use as a marker of ADHD risk across development, and particularly in very young children, is limited by unknown reliability, difficulty in aligning canonical band-based measures across development periods, and unclear effects of treatment in later development.
